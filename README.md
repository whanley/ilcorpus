Warning: A quirk of OCR has produced instances of doubled words in the IC text, often as the result of hyphens over line breaks. In some cases, the second of these words is an erroneous replacement of another word in the original text. In other cases, the doubled word is a phantom produced by the auto-completion of two hyphenated halves. It has not been possible for me to correct these errors in any automated way.
